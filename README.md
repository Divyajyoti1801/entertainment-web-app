## Overview

### The challenges:

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
- **Bonus**: If you're building a full-stack app, we provide authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an auth flow

### What I learned
In this project, I set out to build a movie browsing application using popular web technologies such as React JS, Sass, TMDB API, Firebase Authentication, and Redux for state management. Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges and gained valuable insights. Here are some of the key takeaways from this project:

React JS: I learned how to leverage the power of React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create a dynamic and interactive movie browsing application. I gained proficiency in using React components, managing state and props, and implementing lifecycle methods to handle application behavior and UI updates.

Sass: I explored Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor, to enhance the styling and layout of the application. I learned how to write modular and reusable CSS code using Sass features such as variables, mixins, and nested rules. I also gained insights into the benefits of using Sass over traditional CSS and how it can improve the maintainability and scalability of a project.

TMDB API: I integrated the TMDB (The Movie Database) API into the application to fetch movie data such as titles, posters, ratings, and descriptions. I learned how to use API endpoints, handle asynchronous data fetching, and handle errors and exceptions in API calls. I also gained experience in working with API documentation and understanding API response formats.

Firebase Authentication: I implemented Firebase Authentication to enable user authentication and authorization in the movie browsing application. I learned how to set up authentication providers, implement sign-up and login functionality, handle user sessions, and restrict access to authenticated routes. I also gained insights into best practices for securing user data and managing authentication state in a React application.

Redux: I implemented Redux, a popular state management library, to manage the global state of the application. I learned how to define Redux actions, reducers, and stores, and how to connect Redux with React components using the react-redux library. I also gained insights into advanced Redux concepts such as middleware, async actions, and Redux DevTools for debugging and monitoring state changes.

Project Organization and Best Practices: I learned how to structure a complex React application using best practices for component organization, state management, and code separation. I gained insights into optimizing performance through code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization techniques. I also learned how to use development tools such as React DevTools, Redux DevTools, and linters for code quality assurance and debugging.

Testing: I gained experience in writing unit tests and integration tests for React components, Redux actions, and reducers using testing frameworks such as Jest and Enzyme. I learned how to set up testing environments, write test cases, and perform test coverage analysis. I also gained insights into the importance of testing for maintaining code quality and ensuring application stability.

Overall, this project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of building a modern web application using React JS, Sass, TMDB API, Firebase Authentication, and Redux for state management. I learned how to tackle challenges related to component-based UI development, styling, data fetching, authentication, state management, and testing. I also gained insights into best practices and tools for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
